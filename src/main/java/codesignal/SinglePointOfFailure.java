	/**
	 * Sue is a network administrator who consults for companies that have massive
	 * Local Area Networks (LANs). The computers are connected together with network
	 * cables, and Sue has been brought in to evaluate the company’s network. The
	 * networks are huge, and she wants to ensure that no single network cable
	 * failure can disconnect the network. Any cable that fails that leaves the
	 * network in two or more disconnected pieces is called a single point of
	 * failure.
	 * 
	 * She labels the different network devices from 0 to n - 1. She keeps an n × n
	 * matrix connections, where connections[i][j] = 1 if there is a network cable
	 * directly connecting devices i and j, and 0 otherwise. Write a function that
	 * takes the matrix of connections, and returns the number of cables that are a
	 * single point of failure.
	 * 
	 * @param connections - adjacency list.
	 * @return the number of cables that are a single point of failure.
	 * 
	 *         For connections = [[0, 1], [1, 0]], the output should be
	 *         solution(connections) = 1. A failure of the cable that connects
	 *         devices 0 and 1 would leave the network disconnected.
	 * 
	 *         For connections = [[0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]], the output
	 *         should be solution(connections) = 0. No failure of a single network
	 *         cable would result in the network being disconnected.
	 * 
	 *         For connections = [[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0,
	 *         0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0,
	 *         0]], the output should be solution(connections) = 3.
	 * 
	 *         For connections = [[0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
	 *         [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]], the output should be
	 *         solution(connections) = 4.
